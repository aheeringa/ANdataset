function fsl2bins = getFSL2bins(N,cent,delay)
%%
% The 2 bins method, after KÃ¶ppl, 1997, J Neurophysiol

% input:
%   N: after a histogram was made from all spiketimes, N is the height of
%       the bins in the histogram
%   cent: cent are the centers of the bins in the histogram, a time vector
%   delay: the delay between start of recording and start of the click
% output:
%   fsl2bins: the first spike latency based on the 2 bins method.
